# Invoice Bot

An invoice discord bot for mYinsanity.

Currently I've given it to Domi as a binary compiled for Linux. 

If they need new features Domi is now a collaborator and he can add tickets to this and I'll work on them and fix stuff as it goes on. 

## To run

If you have a binary make sure to have a `.env` file in the same folder as the binary. 
The `.env` file should contain your DISCORD_TOKEN in the format:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=_______________________
```

### Get binary
You can get the binary from the release section of this repo

## To compile

You probably need a nightly version of Rust and cargo. Then just clone the repo and run `cargo build --release`
