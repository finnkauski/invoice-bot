# Invoice Bot

An invoice discord bot for mYinsanity.

Currently I've given it to Domi as a binary compiled for Linux. 

If they need new features Domi is now a collaborator and he can add tickets to this and I'll work on them and fix stuff as it goes on. 

# To compile

You probably need a nightly version of Rust and cargo. Then just clone the repo and run `cargo build --release`
